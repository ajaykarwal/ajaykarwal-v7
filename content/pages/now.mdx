Here are some of the things I’m currently focused on.

**Last updated:** January 2021.

## Work
I'm currently in the early stages of planning a redesign of my website. It's something I do roughly every two years to keep on top of new trends and technologies.

I'll probably keep the site built on Gatsby for now and simply make this a cosmetic change.

In my day job I'm working on new features for our Angular application as well as refactoring some of the existing code.

## Reading
I've been reading [Rich Dad's Cashflow Quadrant](https://amzn.to/2Jgo3Z4) by Robert Kiyosaki for a while now. Progress has been slow, but I'm going to stick with it.

## Watching
I'm currently watching [The Crown](https://www.netflix.com/gb/title/80025678) on Netflix.

## Gaming
I recently reached [100% completion](https://www.reddit.com/r/Breath_of_the_Wild/comments/g44qc1/this_is_both_satisfying_and_quite_upsetting/) on The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild. Took me a little over 180 hours of game play but it was totally worth it!

I'm really excited to see what the sequel to Breath of the Wild has to offer. Bring it on!
