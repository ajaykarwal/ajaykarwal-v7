Today I learned how to set up Continuous Integration using Travis CI. What this essentially means is that I can now make an update to this website, push to GitHub and have Travis CI automatically trigger a build and if it's successful, deploy the update to Azure.

It was _reasonably_ simple to get running. I ran into a few issues so I'll be writing a more in-depth article about the process soon.

I guess I can add dev-ops to my CV now too! üòÅ
