[Ahmed Awais](https://twitter.com/MrAhmadAwais) shared this simple tip to empty a JavaScript Array.

```javascript
arr.length = 0
```

So simple right? But why would you want to do this?

Perhaps your application uses an array to store a list of products, and when a user applies a filter facet, you could empty the array before populating it again with the new set of filtered products.
