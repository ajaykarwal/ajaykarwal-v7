[JavaScript Jeep](https://javascriptjeep.com) recently shared an article on ways to use the Spred operator.

Spread operator expands an iterable object (i.e. an Array) into its individual element. An iterable object is anything that you can loop over.

```javascript
let fruits = ['🍈', '🍉', '🍋', '🍌'];

console.log(...fruits); //🍈 🍉 🍋 🍌
```
