You can easily check which version of jQuery is loaded on a page (or whether it is loaded at all) by running either of these commands in your browser console.

```shell
jQuery().jquery

jQuery.fn.jquery

$().jquery

$.fn.jquery
```

All four of these commands will return the same result. If jQuery is loaded successfully, you will recieve the version number, e.g `3.5.1`.

If jQuery is not loaded you will recieve a message along the lines of `ReferenceError: jQuery is not defined`.

Do you still use jQuery in your projects? Is the library still relevant considering the advances in vanilla JavaScript?
