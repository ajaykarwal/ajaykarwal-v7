There are multiple ways to write <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheet">CSS</abbr> for your website and the method you choose may vary depending on your chosen CMS or framework, but essentially it boils down to one of the following methods.

- [Inline Styles](#Inline-Styles)
- [Style Tag](#Style-Tag)
- [Linked Stylesheet](#Linked-Stylesheet)

## Inline Styles

Inline styles are added directly to the element which they are to be applied to.

```html
<p style="background-color: indianred; color: palegoldenrod; padding: 10px;">
  Some paragraph text
</p>
```

which would render as

<p style="background-color: indianred; color: palegoldenrod; padding: 10px;">
  Some paragraph text
</p>

Because the styles are applied directly to an element, they do not impact any other elements on the page, so this particular styling will not apply to any other `<p>` elements on the page.

```html
<div>
  <p style="background-color: indianred; color: palegoldenrod; padding: 10px;">
    A styled paragraph
  </p>
  <p>
    An unstyled paragraph
  </p>
</div>
```

### Pros

- Styles are scoped only to the element they are applied to so there are no [cascading](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Cascade) issues.
- All the styles are contained within the HTML file so only one request needs to be made to the server to fetch your page.

### Cons

- Managing a large code base is virtually impossible
- HTML markup becomes bloated

## Style Tag

The `<style>` tag is used to define styling information for a HTML document.

It's recommended to place the `<style>` tag in the `<head>` section of your HTML.

The above inline style translated into a `<style>` tag would look like this.

```html
<head>
  <style>
    p {
      background-color: indianred;
      color: palegoldenrod;
      padding: 10px;
    }
  </style>
</head>
```

The key difference here is that the styling now applies to all `<p>` tags on the page. This is where the cascading (the 'C' in CSS) comes into play.

### Pros

- Styles are all defined in a single place making them easier to find and manage
- Still only one request needs to be made to the server to fetch your page.
- HTML markup becomes cleaner

### Cons

- Styles are available only to the page on which the `<style>` tag is present.

## Linked Stylesheet

A linked stylesheet would contain your css declarations in a separate file and be linked in the `<head>` section of your HTML like this.

```html
<head>
  <link src="/path/to-your/stylesheet.css" type="text/css" rel="stylesheet" />
</head>
```

We can now move all the css declarations from the `<style>` tag to an external stylesheet which would look like this.

<div className="file">stylesheet.css</div>

```css
p {
  background-color: indianred;
  color: palegoldenrod;
  padding: 10px;
}
```

As with the `<style>` tag, cascading rules also apply when using linked stylesheets.

### Pros

- Styles are fully separated from markup
- A single stylesheet can be linked to multiple pages of your website

### Cons

- The server now needs to make two requests &mdash; one for the `.html` file and one for the `.css` file

## In Conclusion

So which method should you use? Of course, as with most things, it depends.

While all three methods have their benefits and drawbacks, a lot can be said about having styles de-coupled from markup, so having your CSS in a linked stylesheet is the approach I would recommend.

However, sometimes you need to apply some additional inline styling to override [specificity](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Specificity) on a particular element.

There is also the concept of [critical css](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2015/08/understanding-critical-css/) which uses a combination of inline and external css. You can even [automate this](https://github.com/addyosmani/critical) as part of your build process.
