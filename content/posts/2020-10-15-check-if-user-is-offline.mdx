It's pretty easy to check if a user is offline with javascript.

```javascript
window.addEventListener('offline', () => console.log('is offline'))
```

This can be useful to display a warning if your application auto-saves at a regular interval.

If the user is offline, the auto-save may fail so a warning message would be a good bit of UX here.
