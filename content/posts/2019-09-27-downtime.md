Occasional downtime is part of the fabric of working for an agency, whether it’s between projects or simply awaiting client feedback.

This may seem like a blessing. A much needed break from your busy schedule while essentially “getting paid to do nothing.”

But wouldn’t you rather put this free time to better use? It could be an opportunity to learn new skills, help your colleagues, or write up some documentation.

We are hired to provide value to our employers so in return we should always find opportunities to do so.

Besides, it’s much harder to look busy than it is to be busy.
